#  SQL Product Sales Analysis  

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze **product sales performance** across multiple dimensions.  
Each SQL file represents a distinct business query, enabling modular, question-driven analysis.

##  Key Analysis Performed  

- **Monthly Sales Performance** → Track revenue trends over time  
- **Revenue by Customer Type** → Compare retail vs wholesale contributions  
- **Revenue by Product Type & Sales** → Identify top-performing product categories  
- **Revenue by Region** → Understand geographical sales distribution  
- **Total Product Sales** → Overall sales by product  
- **Total Revenue** → Consolidated revenue snapshot  

---

##  Tech Stack  

- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** → Querying, aggregation, joins, grouping  
- **Excel (.csv/.xlsx)** → Input dataset for analysis  
- **Relational Databases** → Business intelligence & reporting

##  Outcome  

- Delivered **granular insights** across product, region, and customer segments  
- Built a **reusable SQL query library** for business reporting  
- Provided a foundation for **data-driven sales strategies**
